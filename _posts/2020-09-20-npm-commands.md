### What is npm?
Recently I completed a learning path on [node js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-nodejs/) and found some basic and useful npm commands which were very helpful to me, so I thought of sharing.

Here are some useful npm commands.

- To create a package.json in interactive mode, you can use the npm init command.

  **`npm init`**

 - To create a package.json in non interactive mode, use the npm init -y command.

	**`npm init -y`**

- To get full detailed list of all the commands, type npm --help.

  **`npm --help`**

- To install any package, you can use npm install command followed by package name.

  **`npm install <package name>`**

### Wrap up
These were some basic and useful nom commands that can get you started with npm.

Happy Coding.
