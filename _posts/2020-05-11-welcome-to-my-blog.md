Welcome to my first blog post. I intend to keep this very small and sweet, since I am testing the blog functionality with this blog. So you will find nothing special here.
## About Me
My name is Bhavesh Vaghela and I am born and brought up in Ahmedabad, which is a city located in Gujarat state of India. 
## Education
After my 10+2 scholling, I have done Diploma in Comptuer Engineering from A.V. Parekh Technical Institute, Rajkot. Once diploma completed, I started pursuing B.E. Computer Engineering course in Nirma Institute of Technology.
